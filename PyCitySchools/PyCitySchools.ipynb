    "#### 1.  Higher per student spend does not produce higher test results.  It was shown in a couple of the tables that there is actually a correlation of more money being spent leading lower test scores.  The Scores by School Spending is the most obvious example, but if you look at the top 5 scoring schools and compare them the the bottom 5 scoring schools; this trend is evident in the numbers seen there as well.\n",

    "#### 2. Smaller school size is indicative of higher test scores and passing rates.  It it appears that the schools with fewer students are doing better on the testing based on the Scores by School Size table and comparing the top 5 and bottom 5 schools.  This could be due to smaller class sizes and more individalized attention.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. While it would be easy to assume that the Charter schools, which appear to have less funding and smaller sizes, are doing better only due to those reasons; there are factors not accounted for in this data.  Often charter schools do not have the support services in place (hence the lower funding) for students with learning disabilities.  This could be contributing to lower scores in the better funded schools with more students."
